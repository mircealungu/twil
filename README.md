## Week #32

- The *Two and Done Rule* (the last idea in the essay at [An Old Hacker's Tips on Staying Employed](https://madned.substack.com/p/an-old-hackers-tips-on-staying-employed)): 

	- Don't argue more than twice about any topic at work; state your point; state it one more time; then let go graciously, possibly acknowledge, and go with their way. 

	- This is something I could have used in the past... I remember that once, during a workshop I antagonized an entire group of people trying to argue over and over with them that the project we were paid to work on "was not going to work". Nobody wanted to hear that, and eventually I made myself persona non grata.

- [TripMode](https://tripmode.ch/) - A nice app for easily monitoring and controlling network traffic on OS X. Especially useful when sharing the phone's data connection abroad with limited data roaming.  

- Boetius. The consolation of Philosophy. Prison literature. Meditations on fortune. Happiness comes from within. Virtue is the one thing one truly has, because it is not at the hand of fortune.
