# Week 3



## Technical 

* fgrep = version of grep that searches for the fixed string (i.e., no regex)
  * example, all the student projects that use `props.children` 

    `fgrep -R --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.react-bratus --exclude-dir=public 'props.children' .`


## Philosophy

* plato & aristotle: essence precedes existence; every object and thing has an essence; the thing that makes it so; e.g. a football has non-essential properties; but also some essential properties; and they exist before it
sartre: existence precedes essence; 

* kirkegaard: the anxiety of freedom

* sartre: bad faith: when you lie to yourself just for the comfort;

* nietsche: 

  * the need for meaning is universal, this is why so many solutions in so many different cultures and contexts

  * **true world theory** - a perfect world that satisfies the human need for meaning; stems from the dissatisfaction with the imperfection of our world; examples of true worlds can be found in religion but also seculary ideologies that are looking for establishing a perfect world here on earth 

  * he finds that religion and alcohol are both trying to solve existential angst by runnign from reality


## History

* I re-found the amazing audio lectures on history that I was listening to during my PhD - would be nice to restart listening -  http://www.infocobuild.com/education/audio-video-courses/history/History5-Fall2010-Berkeley/lecture-06.html 



## Art

* chagal, The Promenade - https://www.wikiart.org/en/marc-chagall/the-promenade-1918



## Zeitgeist

* djokovic seems to have paid somebody to generate a positive test for him, and then a negative test after so he looks like he's healed: https://republica.ro/salutari-din-melbourne-locul-unde-s-a-spart-zbuba-lantul-slabiciunilor-erorilor-si-ilegalitatilor-in-cazul

* expression I saw somewhere: "Djokovic lives in your head without rent"; why do we care about these famous folks?



## Life

* Why are there only a handful of names thatwe all know in tennis - https://www.quora.com/What-separates-the-world%E2%80%99s-1-tennis-player-from-the-250-one-Does-the-1-player-just-have-slightly-less-unforced-errors-slightly-faster-serve-etc-that-accumulate-to-make-him-her-more-likely-to-win-a-5-set-match-or-is-he-she-just-better 

* Interview with Gigi Buffon - about depression - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89KdxJomDzg 






# Week 2

## Technical

* brew services = e.g., `brew services restart mysql`, adapter for launchctl and launchd
* brew = installs everything in `/opt/homebrrepeew` for ARM architectures (was /usr/local)#35 
* (adapter, facade, proxy) = (adapts to a new interface, simplifies a complex interface, stands for another object possibly doing some housekeeping in the process) ([so](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3489187))
* ElasticSearch = filter vs. query: filter is boolean; query results in a ranking of documents
* Trying setup with three monitors; mouse cursor is lagggy and freezes on one of the dells; switching the cable from hdmi to usb-c/thunderbolt, as this [seems to have solved the problem for others](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/resolved-external-monitors-and-mouse-lag.2194467/)




## Philosophy

* Kant = the [thing in itself](https://www.britannica.com/topic/thing-in-itself) we can not know; we can only know the perception of the thing; quite philosophical, one must admit
  * categorical imperative - act only according to that maxim that you would like to become a universal law

* Mary Wollstonecraft -- educating women to be slaves is what society was doing in her time; at time when rights of men and slavery were being debated; rights of women in 1792. 

* Hegel = thesis, synthesis, antithesis = is he simply observing the way we steer any system? constantly adjusting a bit to the left, a bit to the right; probably we can understand him if we think in terms of cybernetics

* Thoreau = the more you own, the more the things you own own you. does it apply to research too? 



## Culture

* https://quillette.com/2022/01/12/against-land-acknowledgements/ - article about a professor who wrote his own land acknowledgement and scared his university



## Music

* fingerpicking style - anchoring the pinky: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWSSS7tJ2wQ
* Mark Knopflder on fingerpicking - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvdPB97-C5o


## Random

* “You cannot define a person on just one thing. You can’t just forget all these wonderful and good things that a person has done because one thing didn’t come off the way you thought it should come off.” ~ Aretha Franklin
* good twitter list: tools for thought: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1431302825858977795

* better watch the sunrise on jan 1st than count at midnight :)



## Teaching

* tacit knowledge transmission is higher-bandwidth than explicitly explaining stuff
  - .. powerful moment when students realize teacher actually doesn't know why a bug is happening, and they can genuinely debug together as a normal part of the creative process


* for the future: debugging as a topic
  - Perhaps ironically, I often find debugging a tricky bug to be way more fun than other parts of programming. Hard enough to feel rewarding, easy enough to be tractable, and there's a tangible benefit from solving the mystery. Sort of a chance to do science on easy mode.
  - Geoffrey Litt @geofreylitt


## Personal

* pay more attention to how you dress and present yourself - would it hurt you if you presented like this? https://ddsks.dk/en/ansatte/rasmus-olme


* and embedding links in an embedded svg file: ![embedded svg](./link_in_svg.svg)

* added the `cape` aias == commit-and-push-w/-empty-message...

* streamdeck - led keyboard that's programmable? 



# Week 1

* David Hume - Scottish Enlightenment
	* a skeptical guy who was also jolly; reminds me of Niko; ("Poor David Hume is dying fast, but with real cheerfulness and good humor and with real resignation to the necessary course of things", Adam Smith)
	* Excellent at spotting assumptions (e.g. the argument of the great watchmaker; you are assuming you can make a comparison between a watch and a universe; you are assuming that there had to be a creator - could have been many causes; could have been many universes; you are finally assuming that the creator is your god; could be any of the othe ones; also, you are assuming it's one god; but could have been a committee, e.g.)
	* if we accept the existence of an intelligent designer, what have we accepted the existence of? if we accept the existence of a soul, what have we accepted the existence of? if it's eternal, what makes you think it wasn't there before?
	* and if human intelligence needed a designer, who designed the intelligence of the designer? 
	* "When anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should really have happened."
	* "A wise man always proportions his belief to the evidence."

 
* Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan
	* state of nature - no property; it's not that you don't have anything; it's worse; it's that everything belongs to everybody; and everything is constantly up for grabs; 
	* without a Leviathan, a strong state, there is no guarantee of anybody respecting the social contract
	* there is no "injustice" when no laws are put in place. Whether something is "good" or "bad" or "right" or "wrong" really only is present when there is a goal that is trying to be achieved
	* if you're one of the people that think that deep down, humans are good Hobbes would say: why lock the door at night? 

	>  "In such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"

	
	* Humans eventually realize in this state of nature is that they could achieve a higher level of self-preservation, that is, a life without all of this constant looking over your shoulder and uncertainty, they could achieve that life if they could eliminate this threat of other humans.
	* Government is a necessary evil
	* Because we are reasoning creatures, that if we use our ability to reason and think about what behavior would yield the greatest quality of self-preservation, we naturally arrive at certain principles. This is why the collection of them is aptly named "Natural Law". 
	* The sovereign. The leader with absolute authority to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants in the interest of maintaining the contract. 
		* While in the state of nature, we have complete control over our lives to go where ever we want, take what ever we want, kill whoever we want, but 
		* when we sign the social contract, which is without question a more self-preserving lifestyle, we forfeit much of that control over what we can do to the sovereign. 
		* His job, is to keep us OUT of that terrible, perpetual state of war that we would otherwise find ourselves in. 
		* The laws the sovereign puts in place in the interest of keeping us OUT of a perpetual state of war ARE the moral order that you are beholden to. 
		* Because the sovereign is the moral authority, it doesn't matter how tyrannical or seemingly terrible he is to you, no matter how bad it is he is still keeping you out of the state of nature, which is without question, much worse for you.
